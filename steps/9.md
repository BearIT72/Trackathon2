Add a new tab after "Filter POIs" named "Route".
The tab will contain:
- a mini dashboard summarizing how many routes are created
- a general section with a button to launch treatment and a button to purge data
- the treatment consist in making a call described in the file input/examples/gh_curl where points will be the list of the first point of the orignal track, the filtered POIs in the order they should be encountered and the last point of the original track
- a table listing the hikes already routed with a refresh button, a purge button and a view button
- the view button will trigger the display of yet antoher map where the orignal track will be displayed in blue, the generated route displayed in green, the points of departure as a green waypoint, the point of arrival as a red waypoint
- there should be a button below the map to go back to the list

1. Explore the project structure to understand the application architecture
2. Examine the existing tabs implementation to understand how to add a new tab
3. Understand the data models for tracks, POIs, and routes
4. Create a new Route model if needed
5. Implement a RouteService to handle API calls to the routing service
6. Create the Route tab UI with all required components
7. Implement the functionality for treatment button
8. Implement the table listing routed hikes
9. Implement the map view for displaying routes
10. Add navigation between views
11. Test the implementation

A new "Route" tab was successfully added to the application, featuring a mini dashboard for route counts, buttons for treatment and data purging, a table for listing routed hikes, and a map view displaying the original track and generated routes. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.

In the request to route longitude comes first and latitude after, the filtered POIs have this properly named, but the points of departure and arrival should have their coordinates inverted

1. Understand the issue by examining the route request format and how coordinates are currently handled
2. Locate the code that constructs route requests, particularly focusing on how departure and arrival points are processed
3. Examine the models related to routes, tracks, and points to understand the data structure
4. Check how POIs are handled in the route request to understand the correct implementation
5. Modify the code to invert coordinates (longitude/latitude) for departure and arrival points
6. Test the changes to ensure they resolve the issue
7. Submit the solution

The coordinates for departure and arrival points in the route requests were corrected by modifying the `extractCoordinatesFromGeoJson` method to create `Point` objects with the coordinates swapped (longitude first, then latitude). The implementation is error-free, and all necessary changes have been made to ensure proper handling of coordinates.

the route call returns points in encoded polyline format, decrypt it before storing it

1. Understand the current route handling flow
- Examine relevant files to understand how routes are processed
- Identify where route data is received from API
- Locate where route data is stored
2. Find where encoded polyline data is being handled
3. Implement decoding of the polyline before storage
- Implement a polyline decoder utility
- Modify the `generateRouteForTrack` method to decode the polyline before storing
4. Test the changes to ensure they work correctly
- No existing tests for RouteService
- Created a test for PolylineUtils
- Run the test to verify polyline decoding
5. Submit the solution

A polyline decoding functionality was implemented in the RouteService to decode encoded polyline data before storing it in the database. The implementation is error-free, and the associated tests for the polyline decoding passed successfully.
