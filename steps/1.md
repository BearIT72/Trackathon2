Initialize a ktor based web app with up to date dependencies

1. Explore the repository structure to understand what we're working with
2. Create a basic Ktor project structure
- Create src directory structure
- Create build configuration file (build.gradle.kts)
- Create settings.gradle.kts
3. Set up the build configuration with up-to-date Ktor dependencies
4. Create the main application file
5. Set up basic routing
6. Configure application modules
- Add logging configuration
7. Add necessary resources and templates
- Create application.conf
- Create HTML templates
8. Update the main application to use the HTML templates
9. Create a simple API model and endpoint
- Create API models
- Update routing to include API endpoints
10. Create a test for the application
- Create test directory structure
- Create API test
11. Build the project
12. Run the tests to verify the application works correctly
13. Summarize the project structure and features

A Ktor-based web application was successfully initialized with up-to-date dependencies, including HTML templates and API endpoints. The build completed without errors, indicating that the code is syntactically correct and dependencies are properly configured. However, tests could not be executed due to issues with the test runner environment.
