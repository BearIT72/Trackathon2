Add a new tab after import, named POIs, this tab will have a button Search POIs that will trigger an Overpass search for points of interests located in the bbox enclosing the coordinates of the tracks stored in the table InputData. The results should be stored in a new table with a reference to inputdata. Also this new tab should have a table with the count of POIS found for each track, and once again a purge button to purge the data from this table

1. Understand the current application structure and data models
2. Examine how the existing tabs and pages are implemented
3. Create a new database table for storing POI data with reference to InputData
- Define POITable with reference to InputDataTable
- Create POIEntity for database operations
- Create POIDTO for API responses
4. Add a new tab for POIs in the navigation
5. Create a template for the POIs page with:
- Search POIs button
- Table showing POI counts per track
- Purge button
6. Fix import issues in HtmlTemplates.kt
7. Implement the backend functionality for:
- Update database initialization to include POITable
- Add routes for the POIs page
- Implement helper functions for POI operations
- getPOICountsByTrack()
- searchAndStorePOIs()
- purgePOIData()
8. Test the new functionality

A new "POIs" tab was added to the application, featuring a "Search POIs" button that triggers an Overpass API search for points of interest based on track coordinates, with results stored in a new database table. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.
