In the "POIs" tab, above the button to "Search POIs" add a panel to select which map features to retrieve, the list of map festures available can be retrieved here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features, consider only the primary ones

1. Understand the current structure of the "POIs" tab and how it's implemented
2. Identify where the "Search POIs" button is defined
3. Research the primary map features from OpenStreetMap wiki
4. Design a panel to select map features
5. Modify the POIService to accept a list of selected map features
- Update searchAndStorePOIs method
- Update searchAndStorePOIsForTrack method
- Update searchAndStorePOIsForMissingTracks method
6. Implement the panel in the appropriate file
7. Connect the panel to the POI search functionality
- Move the checkboxes inside the form
- Update the route handlers in Application.kt
- Update `/pois/search` route
- Update `/pois/search/{hikeId}` route
- Update `/pois/search-missing` route
- Update the "Search POIs for All Tracks Missing Them" button
- Update the "Refresh" buttons in the POI counts table
- Add JavaScript to handle the "Refresh" buttons
8. Test the implementation

A panel was successfully added above the "Search POIs" button in the "POIs" tab to allow users to select which primary map features to retrieve. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed, enabling dynamic querying of POIs based on user-selected features.

Add the checkboces for sublevels, if the main level is checked, all sublevels will be used

1. Research the sublevels for each primary map feature from OpenStreetMap wiki
2. Modify the map features selection panel in HtmlTemplates.kt to include sublevels
- Add expandable sections for each primary feature
- Add checkboxes for sublevels under each primary feature
- Implement JavaScript to handle the parent-child relationship between checkboxes
3. Update the POIService.kt to handle sublevel selections
- Modify the query building logic to include specific sublevels when selected âœ“ (for searchAndStorePOIs)
- Update searchAndStorePOIsForTrack method signature
- Update searchAndStorePOIsForTrack query building logic
- Update searchAndStorePOIsForMissingTracks method
4. Update the Application.kt to pass sublevel selections to POIService
- Update the /pois/search route handler
- Update the /pois/search/{hikeId} route handler
- Update the /pois/search-missing route handler
5. Test the implementation
- Verify that checking a main level selects all its sublevels
- Verify that the correct Overpass API queries are generated based on selections

Checkboxes for sublevels were successfully added to the map features selection panel, allowing users to select specific sublevels when a main level is checked. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed, enabling dynamic querying of POIs based on user-selected features and their sublevels.
