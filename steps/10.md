in the dashboard of the POIs tab add a count of hikes without POIS, make the table displaying the POIS count sortable and add lines even for the hikes that don't have POIs

1. Explore the project structure to understand the application architecture
2. Locate the files related to the POIs tab and dashboard
3. Understand how the POIs count is currently displayed
4. Identify how the table is implemented and how to make it sortable
5. Determine how to add hikes without POIs to the table
6. Implement the necessary changes
   a. Modify the `getPOICountsByTrack()` method to include hikes without POIs
   b. Update the dashboard to display the count of hikes without POIs
   c. Make the table sortable
   d. Update Application.kt to pass the hikesWithoutPOIs parameter
7. Test the implementation
8. Submit the solution

A count of hikes without POIs was added to the dashboard, the table displaying POIs count was made sortable, and hikes without POIs are now included in the table. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.

Add a row count at the bottom of all tables

1. Explore the project structure to understand where tables are implemented in the application
2. Identify all HTML tables in the templates
3. Determine the best approach to add row counts at the bottom of each table
4. Implement the row count feature for each table
   a. Add a footer row to each table
   b. Calculate the row count
   c. Display the count in the footer
5. Check for any other tables in the application
6. Test the implementation
7. Submit the solution

A row count was successfully added at the bottom of all tables in the application, including the POI counts table, filtered POI counts table, and routes table. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.

in the dashboard of the filter POIs tab add a list of the hikes that don't have a list of POis with a button to try to generate them

1. Explore the project structure to understand the application architecture
2. Locate the files related to the POIs tab and dashboard
   a. Examine the POIService.kt to understand how POIs are managed
   b. Find and examine the template file for the filter POIs tab
3. Understand how POIs are currently displayed and filtered
4. Identify how to get a list of hikes without POIs
5. Determine where and how to add the list of hikes without POIs in the UI
6. Implement the necessary changes:
   a. Modify the backend to provide a list of hikes without POIs
   b. Update the HtmlTemplates.kt to add the hikesWithoutPOIs parameter to filterPoisPageContent
   c. Update the Application.kt to pass the list of hikes without POIs to the template
   d. Update the HtmlTemplates.kt to display this list and add buttons to generate POIs
   e. Update all places in Application.kt where filterPoisPageContent is called
7. Test the implementation
8. Submit the solution

A list of hikes without POIs was successfully added to the filter POIs tab in the dashboard, along with buttons to generate POIs for each hike. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.

make all tables sortable  that are not already

1. Identify all HTML tables in the application
2. Determine which tables are already sortable and which ones need to be made sortable
   a. Check the table in HtmlTemplates.kt at line 456 (already sortable)
   b. Check the table in HtmlTemplates.kt at line 657 (needs to be made sortable)
   c. Check the table in HtmlTemplates.kt at line 724 (needs to be made sortable)
   d. Check the table in routePageContent.kt at line 87 (needs to be made sortable)
3. Implement sorting functionality for each table that is not already sortable
   a. Add sorting script for each table
   b. Add onclick attributes to table headers
   c. Ensure proper sorting for different data types (text, numbers)
4. Test the implementation
5. Submit the solution

All tables in the application that were not already sortable have been updated with sorting functionality. The implementation is error-free, and the build completed successfully with all tests passing.

Filtered POI Counts by Track should display all hikes event if there is not data in the table FILTERED_POIS_DATA

1. Understand how the Filtered POI Counts table is currently implemented
   a. Examine the FilterPOIService.kt to understand how filtered POI counts are retrieved
   b. Examine the HtmlTemplates.kt to see how the filtered POI counts are displayed
2. Identify the issue in the current implementation
- The issue is that `getFilteredPOICountsByTrack()` only returns tracks that have filtered POIs
3. Modify the code to display all hikes in the Filtered POI Counts table
   a. Update the getFilteredPOICountsByTrack() method to include all hikes
   b. Ensure hikes without filtered POIs show a count of 0
4. Test the implementation
5. Submit the solution

The `getFilteredPOICountsByTrack()` method was modified to ensure that the Filtered POI Counts table displays all hikes, including those without any filtered POIs, which now show a count of 0. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed successfully.
