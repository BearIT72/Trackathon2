Add a new tab "Filter POIs", this tab will contain:
- a mini dashboard to view the new count of POIs
- a general section with a button "Filter POIs"
- filtering POIs mean keeping only the POIs close to the original track (maximum 500m), add a parameter in the tab to choose the max number of POIs to keep
- If there is more than the max number filter the POIs to have them the most evenly distributed along the original track as possible
- if there less than the maximum number create artificial ones distributed evenly along the track (they should be on the track if they are artificial)
- these new POIs will be stored in a new table FILTERED_POIS
- there will be a list of hikes with their number of POIS and artifical POIS, a button to redo the treatment and a button to visualize the track on a map that will be displayed beyond the list with the same general concept than the map in the previouos tab

1. Understand the current project structure and how tabs are implemented
2. Examine the existing POI-related functionality
- Look at POIService.kt
- Look at the POI model
- Understand how POIs are stored and retrieved
3. Create a new database table for FILTERED_POIS
- Define FilteredPOITable similar to POITable
- Create FilteredPOIEntity class
- Add DTO classes for filtered POIs
4. Update the database initialization to create the FilteredPOITable
5. Implement the POI filtering service
- Create a new FilterPOIService class
- Fix errors in the FilterPOIService class
- Filter POIs within 500m of the original track
- Implement max POI count parameter
- Implement even distribution of POIs along the track
- Create artificial POIs when needed
6. Create the UI for the new "Filter POIs" tab
- Add a new tab in IndexPage
- Create a new content function for the Filter POIs tab
- Add mini dashboard showing POI counts
- Add button to filter POIs
- Add parameter input for max POI count
- Add list of hikes with POI counts
- Add button to redo treatment
- Add button to visualize track on map
7. Implement the map visualization for filtered POIs
- Create a view page for filtered POIs
- Fix the JavaScript template string issue
8. Update the Application.kt file to handle the new routes
- Update import statements
- Initialize the FilterPOIService
- Add routes for the Filter POIs tab
- Add API endpoint for filter progress
9. Add JavaScript for the filter progress bar
10. Test the new functionality

A "Filter POIs" tab was successfully added, featuring a mini dashboard for POI counts, a filtering button, and functionality to filter or create artificial POIs based on proximity to the original track. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed, ensuring the new features work as intended.

keep the filtered POIs in the order they will be encountered along the track

1. Understand the current implementation of FilterPOIService and how POIs are filtered and ordered
2. Identify where the ordering of filtered POIs needs to be modified
3. Modify the FilterPOIService to ensure POIs are ordered by their position along the track
- Add a position field to the FilteredPOITable to store the position of each POI along the track
- Update the FilteredPOIEntity class to include the position field
- Update the FilteredPOIDTO class to include the position field
- Update the toDTO conversion function to include the position field
- Update the filterPOIsForTrack method to store the position information
- Fix the issues with the current changes
- Update the artificial POI creation section to store the track position information
- Define the PointWithPosition class
- Update the artificial POI creation section to use the new return type
- Update the getFilteredPOIsForTrack method to order POIs by their position
4. Test the changes to verify that filtered POIs are now ordered correctly

A modification was made to the `FilterPOIService` to ensure that filtered POIs are stored and retrieved in the order they will be encountered along the track by adding a `trackPosition` field. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed, confirming that the filtered POIs are now correctly ordered.
