Add a new page in the web app with a button to launch an import of data. The data is available in the file input/flat/id_geojson.csv. The first field is the id of the hike, and the second is a GeoJSON representation of a track. The button will trigger the reading of the input file, the GeoJSON will be mapped in depth and the data should be stored in a new table named inputdata

1. Explore the project structure to understand the codebase better
2. Examine the main application file to understand how the web app is structured
3. Look at the HTML templates to understand how pages are created
4. Check the data models to understand how data is represented
5. Check if there are any database models or tables defined in the project
6. Check the build.gradle.kts file to confirm all necessary dependencies are included
7. Add a CSV parsing library dependency to build.gradle.kts
8. Create a new data model for the imported data
9. Create a new database table for storing the imported data
10. Create a new page with a button to trigger the import
11. Update the routing in Application.kt to include the new import page
12. Fix the errors in the API endpoint for inputdata
13. Fix the path to the CSV file in the importDataFromCsv function
14. Check the database configuration in application.conf
15. Check if the CSV file exists at the specified location
16. Update the path in the importDataFromCsv function to use the correct path
17. Update the text in the import page to reflect the correct file path
18. Check for existing tests
19. Summarize the implementation

A new page was added to the web app with a button to import data from the CSV file located at "inpout/flat/id_geojson.csv", and the data is stored in a new table named "inputdata". The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.
