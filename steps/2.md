Add a H2 database to the project, empty for the time being

1. Examine the build.gradle.kts file to understand the current project dependencies
2. Add H2 database dependency to build.gradle.kts
3. Check if there's any existing database configuration in application.conf
4. Update application.conf with H2 database configuration if needed
5. Verify if any additional code is needed in the Application.kt to initialize the database
6. Add database initialization code to Application.kt
7. Test the changes to ensure the H2 database is properly integrated

An H2 database was successfully added to the project, including the necessary dependencies and configuration in both `build.gradle.kts` and `application.conf`. The database is initialized in the `Application.kt` file, and the implementation is error-free, with the build completing successfully. The database is currently empty as required by the task.
