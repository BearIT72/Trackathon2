Add a new tab named "View POIs", that allows the user to select a hike ID, and display a map with the POIs found for the hike and a blue line representing the track in the original data

1. Explore the project structure to understand the codebase better
2. Examine the existing UI implementation to understand how tabs are created
3. Look at the POI and track data models to understand what data we need to display
4. Check how maps are currently implemented (if at all)
5. Implement the new "View POIs" tab
   a. Create a new HTML template for the tab
   b. Add backend functionality to fetch hike IDs, POIs, and track data
   c. Implement the map display with POIs and track line
6. Update the application to include the new tab
7. Test the implementation

A new "View POIs" tab was successfully added to the application, allowing users to select a hike ID and display a map with associated POIs and the track. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.
