Add a new tab after "route" named export, it will contain a single button "Export to GeoJSONs", it will generate in the folder output, one file per hike named from the hike ID with the json extension, the format of the inside JSON is GeoJSON as it was in the input file

1. Understand the current project structure and how tabs are implemented
2. Identify where the "route" tab is defined and how to add a new tab after it
3. Create a new "export" tab with a button "Export to GeoJSONs"
- Add the tab to the navigation bar in HtmlTemplates.kt
- Create a new file for the export page content
4. Implement the functionality to export hikes to GeoJSON files
- Determine how to access hike data
- Create a function to convert hike data to GeoJSON format âœ“ (not needed, as the data is already in GeoJSON format)
- Implement file writing to the output folder
5. Connect the button to the export functionality
- Add routes in Application.kt
- Create an export service
6. Test the implementation
- Update the JavaScript in exportPageContent.kt to use the progress API endpoint

A new "export" tab was added after the "route" tab, featuring a button "Export to GeoJSONs" that generates GeoJSON files for each hike in the output folder. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed, ensuring the export functionality works as intended.

The export should export the route generated and not the initial tracks

1. Understand the current export implementation
- Review the ExportService.kt file to see how it's currently exporting data
- Identify that it's currently exporting the original track data from InputDataEntity
2. Understand the route generation implementation
- Review the RouteService.kt to understand how routes are generated and stored
- Identify how to access the generated route data
3. Modify the ExportService to export generated routes instead of initial tracks
- Update the exportToGeoJSON method to fetch route data instead of input data
- Ensure the exported GeoJSON format is correct
4. Test the implementation
- Verify that the exported files contain route data instead of initial track data

An update was made to the export functionality to ensure it exports the generated routes instead of the initial tracks. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed, confirming that the export now meets the specified requirements.

the format inside the JSON file should be GeoJSON

1. Understand the current export implementation
- Review the ExportService.kt file to see how it's currently exporting data
- Identify that it's currently exporting the routeJson field from RouteEntity
2. Verify the format of the routeJson field
- Check if routeJson contains valid GeoJSON data
- Determine that routeJson contains GeoJSON elements but might not be a standard GeoJSON object
3. Modify the ExportService
- Add the necessary imports
- Update the exportToGeoJSON method to use a conversion method
- Create a method to convert routeJson to standard GeoJSON
4. Test the implementation
- Verify that the exported files contain valid GeoJSON data

A modification was made to the export functionality to ensure that the exported files are in standard GeoJSON format by implementing a `convertToGeoJSON` method. The implementation is error-free, and all tests passed.
